# Progress

## What's Built

All MVP steps are implemented and running. Expand Store, Shop UI, Plant Types, Context HUD, Cashier Zone, Speed Upgrade, Player Walk, Customer System, Sprite Images, Facing Direction, and Customer Scripts (return customers + questlines) features complete.

Completed step files are moved to [`archive/`](archive/).

### Core (`lua/core/`)

| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `sprite.lua` | Single drawable unit — draws a PNG image scaled to `width × height` if set, colored rectangle otherwise; `color` always applies as a tint |
| `spriteset.lua` | Named collection of sprites, one active at a time; forwards x/y to active sprite on draw |
| `drawer.lua` | Holds drawables sorted by priority, calls draw() each frame |
| `camera.lua` | Translates world → screen; follow(target, lerp) with 0=instant, 1=no movement |
| `scene.lua` | Base class with drawer + camera; on_enter/on_exit lifecycle |
| `scene_manager.lua` | Swaps scenes, calls on_exit/on_enter, delegates update/draw |

---

### Game (`lua/game/`)

| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `assets.lua` | Loads all PNGs once at startup; require-cached so every file can `require` it cheaply; `store_bg_*` and `speech_bubble` loaded conditionally via `try_img` |
| `config.lua` | Shared constants — `U`, `SLOT_COST`, `ZONE_WIDTH` (400px cashier zone) |
| `input.lua` | Polls keyboard each frame; A/D or arrows = move, E = pick up/down, F = interact |
| `game_state.lua` | Holds store, player, currency, `unlocked_plants`, `stage3_counts`, `seen_scripts`; survives scene switches |
| `player.lua` | Moves left/right into cashier zone; holds one item; 4-variant SpriteSet (idle/walk × no-held/held), each backed by a PNG; `speed` upgradeable via shop |
| `slot.lua` | One store cell; single `slot.png` background sprite; positions its item every frame |
| `store.lua` | Array of slots; `slot_at(x)`, `grow()`, `draw_bubbles()` for high-priority bubble rendering; `draw_bg(A)` draws wall tiles and window frames using group-of-4 rule |
| `customer.lua` | Cashier zone NPC; white PNG tinted per character via `body_color`; optional `accessory_sprite` (120×120) drawn over the top half, synced to body flip; dialog lines reveal character-by-character (40 chars/s) inside a 9-slice `speech_bubble.png` box; F skips to full line, second F advances; `line_complete()` / `skip_reveal()` methods; state machine: idle → walking_in → waiting → walking_out; `dismiss()` sends customer away without selling; when waiting, shows a 9-slice speech bubble containing the requested plant's stage-3 image (104×104 inside 12px padding) |

### Items (`lua/game/items/`)

| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `item.lua` | Base class for all carriable objects; `carriable = true`, `sellable = true`, `name = "Item"` by default |
| `watering_can.lua` | interact() waters the plant in the active slot; blue PNG |
| `pc_store.lua` | interact() opens BuyScene; blocked if player is holding anything; `sellable = false`; blue-grey PNG |
| `plant.lua` | 6 types, 3 stages each; per-type cooldown from `plant_data`; stage PNGs rendered as-is (no tinting); yellow bubble via `draw_bubble()` |
| `grafter.lua` | Clones a stage-3 plant (resets original to stage 1, stores clone); `unload()` method handles image swap back to empty; orange PNG (empty) / yellow PNG (loaded) |
| `sell_bin.lua` | Sell station; F while holding any sellable item sells it for currency; red PNG |

### Scenes (`lua/game/scenes/`)

| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `store_scene.lua` | Main loop — player moves, camera follows on x then clamps to world bounds (left = -400+640, right = store width−640), pick up/interact handled here; cashier zone logic (F skips reveal → advances → sells, E dismisses); context HUD bottom-left shows F: SKIP while typing, F: NEXT when done, E: DISMISS when customer waiting; `_active_script_key` tracks the current scripted customer (seen_scripts written on sale, not on spawn); `_script_cooldowns` counts down per completed sale — dismissed scripted customers return after 3 sales; unified parallax tiles `store_bg_*` across full world width pre-drawer; `Store:draw_bg` then stamps walls/windows on top; layered draw order for wall/bubbles |
| `buy_scene.lua` | Carousel UI — 9 items (6 plants + Watering Can + Grafter + Expand Slot); A/D cycle, F buy, E cancel; per-type price and preview color |

### Data (`lua/game/data/`)

| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `plant_data.lua` | Per-type name, buy cost, sell value, and cooldowns for all 6 plant types |
| `customer_scripts.lua` | Array of scripted customer chapters; each has `id`, `chapter`, `trigger` (plant_type + stage-3 count), name, body color, optional `accessory`, requested plant, and dialog messages; same `id` = same character across visits; chapter N requires all prior chapters seen |

### Assets (`assets/`)

PNG files for all sprites — player variants, plants (18 total: 6 types × 3 stages, rendered without tinting), items, UI elements, backgrounds, and speech bubbles.

`assets/accessories/` — accessory PNGs for named customers (120×120, transparent background). Loaded lazily by `A.load_accessory(name)`; missing files are cached as `false` so no disk re-check occurs. Currently contains `flat_cap.png` (Old Pete).

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| A / ← | Move left |
| D / → | Move right |
| E | Pick up / put down (in cashier zone: dismiss customer) |

## Full Loop

**Growing:**
1. Walk to slot 3 (PC) with empty hands → F to open shop
2. F to buy → plant appears in your hand
3. E over an empty slot → place plant
4. Walk to slot 1 → E to pick up watering can
5. Walk back to plant slot → wait for bubble
6. F → waters plant, bubble disappears, stage advances
7. Repeat for stage 2
8. Stage 3 = done, no more bubble

**Selling to a customer:**
1. Customer walks in from the left; if scripted, dialog begins
2. F to advance through their messages
3. Once done talking (or immediately if no dialog), a speech bubble with the plant image appears
4. Pick up the matching stage-3 plant
5. Walk into cashier zone (x < 0) → F to sell for 2× value

**Return customers / questlines:**
- Each time a plant type reaches stage 3, `stage3_counts[pt]` increments
- When a customer spawns, all script chapters whose trigger is met and whose prior chapters have been seen become eligible
- One eligible chapter is picked at random and marked seen (`seen_scripts["id:chapter"]`)
- Characters return across multiple visits as their thresholds are hit, carrying dialog continuity

## Up Next

- **Slot highlight image** — replace the white rectangle highlight with a custom `slot_highlight.png` image (see `slot_highlight.md`)

See open questions in `game-design.md`.

### Recently completed

- **Plant images instead of tinting** — plant sprites now render their stage PNGs as-is; tint removed from `plant.lua`; customer request bubble replaced with a 9-slice speech bubble showing the stage-3 plant image; store preview shows stage-3 image; `colors` field no longer used for rendering
- **Customer dismiss** — E dismisses a waiting customer without selling; scripted characters go on a 3-sale cooldown and return (chapter stays unseen until served); `seen_scripts` now written on sale, not on spawn
- **Typewriter dialogue** — customer dialog lines reveal character-by-character at 40 chars/s inside a 9-slice `speech_bubble.png` box; F skips to the full line, a second F advances; HUD label switches between F: SKIP and F: NEXT; graceful fallback to text-only if the bubble asset is missing
- **Slot item centering** — items now centered using `spr.width`/`spr.height` instead of hardcoded offsets
- **Plant bubble while held** — `Player:draw()` calls `draw_bubble()` on the held item so the bubble is visible while carrying a ready plant
- **Garbage bin replaces sell bin** — `GarbageBin` (F: DISCARD) is the active discard station; `sell_bin.lua` removed
- **Store camera bounds** — camera x clamped after follow so neither screen edge overruns the world; active from the start with 6 slots (world 1800px > screen 1280px)
- **Store background walls** — `Store:draw_bg(A)` tiles `store_wall.png` and places `store_window.png` using a group-of-4 rule; parallax layers (`store_bg_*`) tile across full world width (-ZONE_WIDTH → store:width()) as a single unified system covering both the cashier zone and store; parallax factors 0.05/0.20/0.45
- **Initial slots set to 10** (for testing)

## Cut / Not Yet Built

- Win condition or idle loop
- Customer patience timer (customer never leaves until served)
